# recon
 Automates the reconnaissance of multiple IPv4 targets using industry grade tools such as nmap, rustscan, gobuster, ffuf, dirbuster. 
 This project intends to increase the efficiency of gathering reconnaissance without forfeiting accuracy.
 Compared to remembering each tool's command line parameter syntax, this project aims to deliver reconnaissance as visual as possible.
